Pseudo code: Hangman
	- Interface
		- Word blanks
			- Need to change based on word length
		- Wins
		- Guesses left
		- Letters used
	- Create array for words the computer can choose for the user to guess
		- Create randomizer for computer to pick random words
		- Generate word blanks equal to array.length
	- Create event listener to listen to key pressed
		- If letter is invalid character, report to user
		- If letter is already used, report to user
		- If letter is in word, change blank to letter
		- If letter is not in word, reduce guesses, add to letters used
	- When word is entirely guessed, increase wins and start new game
	- When guesses run out, report loss and restart game
		
		

Extras:
	- Different arrays for different themes
		- pick theme

	- To make different themes...
		- Need empty page with theme pickers 
			- should put in jumbotron as buttons
			- div beneath can be empty/nonexistent
			- buttons can stay in jumbotron in case user wants to pick a different theme
		- on click, js picks a different array
			- based on the array, js assigns a different stylesheet
	- Still need to:
		- reset hang man images
		- clean up code
			- jQuery
			- make reset function to reset the game
			- organize?
		- revisit styles + colors
		-
